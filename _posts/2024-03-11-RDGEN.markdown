# Current State
![rdgen](https://github.com/andjnewb/andjnewb.github.io/assets/71988305/9d8c69ee-d5ec-4be6-a030-a17171fb6361) 

Right now, I can use a BSP-ish algorithm to generate sub-dungeons and rooms within those sub-dungeons. I can also connect each leaf to its sibling.

# Issues 
-If you don't give the algorithm enough coordinates to work with, and split it too much, you start getting "unwrap on none" errors because rooms smaller than
1 don't make sense.  
-I need a way to connect each sub-dungeon that is a parent of the leaves.  
-The way I did the room connecting was probably overly-complex.  
-Everything in the tree view except the coordinates is incorrect, due to the way ptree wants to recursively consume the tree and our method of getting sub-trees.   

#Interesting Bits  
-The BSP isn't stored in a typical linked-list, since this is Rust and doing so would required me to go crazy with RfCell and a bunch of other junk. Instead, it is stored in an array.  

-Nodes contain "references", which are really just indexes, to their child nodes. Thanks to rust's Option, these can be none.  

-Nodes also contain the coordinates for the sub-dungeon they represent, coordinates for the rooms within them(though it will only have a room if it's a leaf), the index of where the node is in the array,
and other misc. stuff.
