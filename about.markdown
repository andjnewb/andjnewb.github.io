## Background  
<p>My interest in computers began at a very young age. My grandmother had a very old Compaq machine with a dial-up connection, and I was completely fascinated with the thing. I would sit cross-legged on her chair, waiting and waiting for just one web-page to load. From then on, I was fascinated. I would spend most of my childhood and adolescence behind a screen, learning more and more about hardware but only ever dipping my toes in programming. I would always hit a road block, and the main problem was that I was just too amibitious for my abilities at the time. College would strengthen my software skills, and after some struggles with life events I would complete my college degree in Computer Science in 2023.

## Interests  

<p>My interests range far and wide, and It would take too long to list them all here. It would be easier to say that if it has to do with a computer, I'm at least tangetically interested in it. I'm sort of at the stage where I need to specialize to land myself a job, and I'm leaning towards Software Engineering on the backend. I have all of the artistic talent of a warm bowl of macaroni, but data fascinates me. I can still produce something that looks decent, as this website hopefully suggests. I like the idea of building apps that extend the functionality of others using the available user-side data. That's why I began my DaD analytics project. I'm currently working on my SQL knowledge and other server-side tech to beef up my knowledge on the backend. In the realm of "touching grass", I like working on small engines and going on the occasional hunting trip with my friends. I deeply enjoy reading, and will give anything from Biographies to High Fantasy a fair chance.

## Current Pursuits  
<p>Right now, I'm working on finding a position at a company post-graduation. I'm doing my best to network, apply, and seeks the advice of others. My current side-project is DaD Analytics, and I'm having to learn a lot about databases and web technology to make it happen. My algorithmic knowledge is fair, but as with most grads I haven't gotten enough specialization yet. I hope that I can find an employer who is willing to look past that and see the potential that I possess.</p>
